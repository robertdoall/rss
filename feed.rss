Primarily known as the colossus of Sci-Fi publishing that brought Speculative Fiction out of the pulp era and mentored some of the great writers of the 20th century, Campbell blends paranoia, isolation, and eldritch terror into a powerful tale of man against...Thing. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Carpenter&#39;s 1982 Sci-Fi Horror classic masterfully adapts the story for the silver screen, and combines tight pacing, effortless characterization, and an ensemble cast with Carpenter&#39;s signature cinematography, an Ennio Morricone score, and some of the best practical effects of all time. </p>
