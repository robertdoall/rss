And be sure to share their ideas for a sequel with the developer: including another strong female role and ensuring that true diversity is shown in the sequel (there were far too many White people in this game to match real life).<br /><br />Follow on Telegram: https://t.me/TheGamerWord14]]></description><link>https://odysee.com/The-Gamer-Word-Episode-23--Furtado-Feminism:60b0bd84e06c31098d97ed354715e4fd544ab29c</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://odysee.com/The-Gamer-Word-Episode-23--Furtado-Feminism:60b0bd84e06c31098d97ed354715e4fd544ab29c</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 17:57:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://player.odycdn.com/api/v3/streams/free/The-Gamer-Word-Episode-23--Furtado-Feminism/60b0bd84e06c31098d97ed354715e4fd544ab29c/7c2def.mpga" length="0" type="audio/mpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Gamer Word on Odysee: The Gamer Word Episode 22- Thot Simulator with Goats]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/f805fb42382c0da0fc12b34ab35dd5c3.webp" width="480" alt="thumbnail" title="The Gamer Word Episode 22- Thot Simulator with Goats" /></p>The men come together to discuss one of the best physics simulator games, and how Twitch went quickly from a gaming community to fake and gay political gatekeeping site.
